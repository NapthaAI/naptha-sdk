# Naptha Python SDK

Naptha is a framework and infrastructure for developing and running multi-agent systems across many devices. The Naptha SDK is made up of:

1. A client for interacting with the Naptha Hub (like the huggingface_hug library but for multi-agent apps)
2. Abstractions for the composable building blocks of multi-agent apps like Agent, Orchestrator, Tool, Environment, Persona, Knowledge Base, and Memory (i.e. Naptha Modules). With Naptha, communication between these modules happens via API.
3. Decorators for easily onboarding modules from agent frameworks like CrewAI.
3. A CLI for interacting with the Naptha Hub and Node

## Pre-requisites

Install Python [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

## Install

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk.git
cd naptha-sdk
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Create a copy of the .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Choose whether you want to interact with a local Naptha node or a hosted Naptha node. For a local node, set ```NODE_URL=http://localhost:7001``` in the .env file. To use a hosted node, set ```NODE_URL=http://node.naptha.ai:7001``` or ```NODE_URL=http://node1.naptha.ai:7001```.

## Get Started

## Sign In or Sign Up

If you have already created an account on the Naptha Hub, you can add the details to HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD and
PRIVATE_KEY in the .env file. If you don't have an account, you can either (a) add values for HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD
and PRIVATE_KEY in the .env file and run `naptha signup`, or (b) run `naptha signup` without values in the .env file and
follow the instructions to create a username and password (in this case, the public/private keypair is randomly
generated, and all details will be saved in the .env file).

## Nodes

### Explore Nodes on the Network

You can use the CLI to see a list of available nodes:

```bash
naptha nodes
```

Make note of a Node ID for running a workflow below.

## Agents

### Interact with the Agent Hub

You can also use the CLI to explore available agents that you can run on a node:

```bash
naptha agents
```

For each agent, you will see a url where you can check out the code.

### Create a New Agent

```bash
naptha agents agent_name -c "description='Agent description' parameters='{tool_name: str, tool_input_data: str}' module_url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg'" 
```

### Update an Agent

```bash
naptha agents agent_name -u "module_version='v0.2'" 
```

### Delete an Agent

```bash
naptha agents -d agent_name
```

### Run an Agent

Now you've found a node and a agent you'd like to run, so let's run it locally! You can use the commandline tool to connect with the node and run the workflow. 

```bash
# usage: naptha run <agent_name> <agent args>
naptha run agent:hello_world_agent -p "firstname=sam surname=altman"
```

Try an agent that uses the local LLM running on your node:

```bash
naptha run agent:simple_chat_agent -p "tool_name='chat' tool_input_data='what is an ai agent?'"
```

## Tools

### Interact with the Tool Hub

You can also use the CLI to explore available tools that you can use:

```bash
naptha tools
```

For each tool, you will see a url where you can check out the code.

### Create a New Tool

```bash
naptha tools tool_name -c "description='Tool description' parameters='{tool_input_1: str, tool_input_2: str}' module_url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg'" 
```

### Update a Tool

```bash
naptha tools tool_name -u "module_version='v0.2'" 
```

### Delete a Tool

```bash
naptha tools -d tool_name
```

### Run a Tool

Now you've found a node and a tool you'd like to run, so let's run it locally! You can use the commandline tool to connect with the node and run the workflow. 

```bash
# usage: naptha run <tool_name> -p "<tool args>"
naptha run tool:generate_image_tool -p "tool_name='generate_image_tool' prompt='A beautiful image of a cat'"
```

### Run an Agent that interacts with the Tool

```bash
naptha run agent:generate_image_agent -p "tool_name='generate_image_tool' prompt='A beautiful image of a cat'" --tool_nodes "node.naptha.ai"
```

## Agent Orchestrators

### Interact with the Agent Orchestrator Hub

You can also use the CLI to explore available agent orchestrators that you can run on a network of nodes:

```bash
naptha orchestrators
```

For each orchestrator, you will see a url where you can check out the code.

### Create a New Agent Orchestrator

```bash
naptha orchestrators orchestrator_name -c "description='Orchestrator description' parameters='{input_parameter_1: str, input_parameter_2: int}' module_url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg'" 
```

### Update an Agent Orchestrator

```bash
naptha orchestrators orchestrator_name -u "module_version='v0.2'" 
```

### Delete an Agent Orchestrator

```bash
naptha orchestrators -d orchestrator_name
```

### Run an Agent Orchestrator across a network of nodes:

You can download and install the modules for an orchestrator without running first using:

```bash
naptha create orchestrator:multiagent_chat --agent_modules "agent:simple_chat_agent,agent:simple_chat_agent" --agent_nodes "node.naptha.ai,node1.naptha.ai" --kb_modules "kb:groupchat_kb" --kb_nodes "node.naptha.ai"
```

You can run the orchestrator module on hosted nodes using:

```bash
naptha run orchestrator:multiagent_chat -p "prompt='i would like to count up to ten, one number at a time. ill start. one.'" --agent_nodes "node.naptha.ai,node1.naptha.ai" --kb_nodes "node.naptha.ai"
```

Or on local nodes:

```bash
naptha run orchestrator:multiagent_chat -p "prompt='i would like to count up to ten, one number at a time. ill start. one.'" --agent_nodes "localhost,localhost" --kb_nodes "localhost"
```

```bash
naptha run orchestrator:babyagi -p "objective='Research the history of football'" --agent_nodes "node.naptha.ai,node1.naptha.ai"
```

```bash
naptha run orchestrator:multiagent_debate -p "initial_claim='Teslas price will exceed $250 in 2 weeks.' max_rounds=2 context='Teslas current price is $207, and recent innovations and strong Q2 results will drive the price up.

News Summary 1:
Tesla stock was lower to start a new week of trading, falling as investors worry about global growth. Shares of the electric-vehicle giant were down 7.3% in premarket trading Monday at $192.33. Stocks around the world were falling as investors fretted that weak economic data signal a recession ahead. Despite positive comments from CEO Elon Musk about Tesla’s sales, the stock has fallen about 16% this year and is struggling to overcome negative global investor sentiment.

News Summary 2:
Tesla faces growing competition and softening demand, impacting its stock price which is trading 43% below its all-time high. The company’s profitability is declining, with earnings per share shrinking 46% year-over-year in Q2 2024. Despite recent price cuts and a plan to produce a low-cost EV model, sales growth has decelerated. Tesla is also involved in autonomous self-driving software, humanoid robots, and solar energy, but these segments may take years to significantly impact revenue.

    "func_name": "delete_cognitive_items",
    "func_input_data": {
        "condition": {"cognitive_step": "reflection"}
    }
}'
```

## Environment Modules

Environment modules in Naptha provide shared state and communication infrastructure for multi-agent workflows. They act as a common space where agents can interact, share information, and maintain persistent state across workflow executions. Think of them as the "world" or "environment" in which agents operate and communicate.

For example, an environment module might:
- Maintain a shared conversation history for a group chat
- Store and manage a knowledge base that multiple agents can read from and write to
- Provide a shared task queue for coordinating work between agents
- Manage game state for multi-agent simulations

### Interact with the Environment Hub

You can also use the CLI to explore available environment modules that you can use with agents:

```bash
naptha environments   
```

### Register a New Environment Module on the Hub

```bash
naptha environments environment_name -c "description='Environment description' parameters='{input_parameter_1: str, input_parameter_2: int}' module_url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg'" 
```

### Update an Environment Module

```bash
naptha environments environment_name -u "module_version='v0.2'" 
```

### Delete an Environment Module

```bash
naptha environments -d environment_name
```

## Personas

### Interact with the Persona Hub

You can also use the CLI to explore available personas that you can use with agents:

```bash
naptha personas
```

For each persona, you will see a url where you can check out the data.

### Create a New Persona

```bash
naptha personas sam_altman_twitter -c "description='Persona for Sam Altman' parameters='{name: str, bio: str, openness: int}' module_url='https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAI/twitter_personas' module_entrypoint='data/sam.json'" 
```

### Update a Persona

```bash
naptha personas sam_altman_twitter -u "module_version='v0.2'" 
```

Make sure that the `module_url` is the url of the main repo (e.g the huggingface dataset, github repo, or repo stored on ipfs) and the `module_entrypoint` is the path to the file in the dataset (currently can be json or yaml).

### Delete a Persona

```bash
naptha personas -d sam_altman_twitter
```

### Run an Agent with a Persona

```bash
naptha run agent:simple_chat_agent -p "tool_name='chat' tool_input_data='who are you?'" --persona_modules "interstellarninja_twitter"
```

```bash
naptha run agent:simple_chat_agent -p "tool_name='chat' tool_input_data='who are you?'" --persona_modules "marketagents_aileenmay"
```

## Local Model Inference 

One of the main functions of a Naptha Module is to access model inference. Naptha Nodes can run inference locally , and do so via the Naptha Inference API. Naptha Modules can import the `InferenceClient` class to interact with the inference provider.

```
import asyncio
from naptha_sdk.schemas import NodeConfigUser
from naptha_sdk.inference import InferenceClient

node = NodeConfigUser(ip="node.naptha.ai", user_communication_port=7001, user_communication_protocol="http")
inference_client = InferenceClient(node)

messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]

response = asyncio.run(inference_client.run_inference({"model": "phi3:mini",
                                             "messages": messages,
                                             "temperature": 0.5,
                                             "max_tokens": 1000}))
                                          
content = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

You can also run inference on a node using the `naptha inference` command:

```bash
naptha inference "How can we create scaling laws for multi-agent systems?" -m "phi3:mini"
```

## Local Node Storage

Naptha Modules often need to store and retreive data locally with the Naptha Nodes that they are running on, and do so via the Naptha Storage API. The Naptha Nodes support several types of storage, including filesystem storage, database storage, and IPFS storage. When building a module, you can import the `StorageClient` class to interact with storage providers. For example, to create a table in a database of a storage provider, you can use the following code:

```
import asyncio
from naptha_sdk.schemas import NodeConfigUser
from naptha_sdk.storage.storage_client import StorageClient
from naptha_sdk.storage.schemas import CreateStorageRequest, StorageType

node = NodeConfigUser(ip="node.naptha.ai", user_communication_port=None, user_communication_protocol="https")
storage_client = StorageClient(node)

schema = {
    "schema": {
        "id": {"type": "TEXT", "primary_key": True},
        "text": {"type": "TEXT", "required": True},
        "embedding": {"type": "vector", "dimension": 384}
    }
}

create_table_request = CreateStorageRequest(
    storage_type=StorageType.DATABASE,
    path="test_embeddings",
    data=schema
)

create_table_result = asyncio.run(storage_client.execute(create_table_request))
print("Create Table Result:", create_table_result)
```

You can also interact with storage directly via the CLI using the `naptha storage` series of commands, followed by the storage type (e.g. `db` `fs`, `ipfs`). For example, to upload a file to node storage, list the files in a directory in node storage, and download a file from node storage, you can use:

```
naptha storage fs create test_upload -f README.md
naptha storage fs list test_upload
naptha storage fs read test_upload
```

For more examples of using database, file system and IPFS storage via Naptha Nodes, see the [docs](https://docs.naptha.ai).
