# Naptha Python SDK

Naptha enables users to build decentralized multi-agent workflows. Decentralized workflows can run on one or more nodes (rather than on one central server), with different LLMs, and with many local data sources, opening up new use cases for AI devs. 

Here's Yohei (creator of BabyAGI) admitting that [BabyAGI isn't a true multi-agent system](https://x.com/yoheinakajima/status/1781183534998380576) since the agents use the same LLM and code base. You can watch a demo video where we run BabyAGI as a true multi-agent system [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzV04zOA0f0).

## Pre-requisites

Install Python [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/):

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

## Install

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk.git
cd naptha-sdk
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Create a copy of the .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to add a value to PRIVATE_KEY in .env. You can generate and output one to the commandline using ```naptha user``` (just copy and paste the value into the .env file).

Choose whether you want to interact with a local Naptha node or a hosted Naptha node. For a local node, set ```NODE_URL=http://localhost:7001``` in the .env file. To use a hosted node, set ```NODE_URL=http://node.naptha.ai:7001``` or ```NODE_URL=http://node1.naptha.ai:7001```.

## Get Started

## Sign Up

You can sign up for an account on the Naptha Hub using the commandline tool:

```bash
naptha signup
```

## Nodes

### Explore Nodes on the Network

You can use the CLI to see a list of available nodes:

```bash
naptha nodes
```

Make note of a Node ID for running a workflow below.

### Check out available Modules

Modules can be workflows, agents or multi-agent systems. Modules typically involve one or more LLMs, along with humans in the loop. You can also use the CLI to explore available modules that you can run on a node:

```bash
naptha modules
```

For each module, you will see a url where you can check out the code. 

### Create a New Module

```bash
naptha modules module_name -p "description='Module description' url='https://github.com/NapthaAI/module_name' type='flow' version='0.1'" 
```

### Run a Module

Now you've found a node and a module you'd like to run, so let's run it locally! You can use the commandline tool to connect with the node and run the workflow. 

```bash
# usage: naptha run <module_name> <module args>
naptha run hello_world -p "param1=world param2=naptha"
```

Try a module that uses the local LLM running on your node:

```bash
naptha run chat -p "prompt='tell me a joke'"
```

You can also try a module that generates images (make sure that the .env file in node has a valid Stability platform API key):

```bash
naptha run generate_image -p "prompt='Beautiful green mountains and clear blue skies. Sun shining and birds chirping. A perfect day for a hike. You are walking through the forest, enjoying the scenery, when you come across a fork in the road. Do you go left or right?'"
```

Now let's run an image-to-image model on this image:

```bash
naptha run image_to_image -p "prompt='Cyberpunk with a wolf' input_dir=<module_run_id_1>"
```

You can also run modules from yaml files using: 

```bash
naptha run create_profile_description -f ./example_yamls/create_profile_description.yml
```

Or docker images:

```bash
naptha run docker_hello_world -f ./example_yamls/docker_hello_world.yml
```

### Interact with Node Storage

After the module runs finish, you can download the file from the node using:

```bash
naptha read_storage -id <module_run_id>
```

You can write to the node using:

```bash
naptha write_storage -i files/<filename>.jpg
```

### Interact with IPFS thorugh Node
```bash
naptha write_storage -i files/<filename>.jpg --ipfs
```

### Run Multi-Node Workflows

```bash
naptha run multiplayer_chat -p "prompt='i would like to count up to ten, one number at a time. ill start. one.'" --worker_nodes "http://node.naptha.ai:7001,http://node1.naptha.ai:7001"
```

```bash
naptha run babyagi -p "objective='Research the history of football'" --worker_nodes "http://node.naptha.ai:7001,http://node1.naptha.ai:7001"
```

```bash
naptha run debate_protocol -p "initial_claim='Teslas price will exceed $250 in 2 weeks.' context='Teslas current price is $207, and recent innovations and strong Q2 results will drive the price up.

News Summary 1:
Tesla stock was lower to start a new week of trading, falling as investors worry about global growth. Shares of the electric-vehicle giant were down 7.3% in premarket trading Monday at $192.33. Stocks around the world were falling as investors fretted that weak economic data signal a recession ahead. Despite positive comments from CEO Elon Musk about Tesla’s sales, the stock has fallen about 16% this year and is struggling to overcome negative global investor sentiment.

News Summary 2:
Tesla faces growing competition and softening demand, impacting its stock price which is trading 43% below its all-time high. The company’s profitability is declining, with earnings per share shrinking 46% year-over-year in Q2 2024. Despite recent price cuts and a plan to produce a low-cost EV model, sales growth has decelerated. Tesla is also involved in autonomous self-driving software, humanoid robots, and solar energy, but these segments may take years to significantly impact revenue.

## Using the SDK non-interactively

To use the SDK as part of a script, start with importing the hub and service subcomponents.
```python
import asyncio
from naptha_sdk.client.naptha import Naptha
from naptha_sdk.client.node import Node
from naptha_sdk.task import Task
from naptha_sdk.flow import Flow
from naptha_sdk.user import generate_user
import os
```


```python
async def main():
  naptha = await Naptha(
      user=generate_user()[0],
      hub_username=os.getenv("HUB_USER"), 
      hub_password=os.getenv("HUB_PASS"), 
      hub_url="ws://node.naptha.ai:3001/rpc",
      node_url="http://node.naptha.ai:7001",
  )

  flow_inputs = {"prompt": 'i would like to count up to ten, one number at a time. ill start. one.'}
  worker_nodes = [Node("http://node.naptha.ai:7001"), Node("http://node1.naptha.ai:7001")]

  flow = Flow(name="multiplayer_chat", user_id=naptha.user["id"], worker_nodes=worker_nodes, module_params=flow_inputs)

  task1 = Task(name="chat_initiator", fn="chat", worker_node=worker_nodes[0], orchestrator_node=naptha.node, flow_run=flow.flow_run)
  task2 = Task(name="chat_receiver", fn="chat", worker_node=worker_nodes[1], orchestrator_node=naptha.node, flow_run=flow.flow_run)

  response = await task1(prompt=flow_inputs["prompt"])

  for i in range(10):
      response = await task2(prompt=response)
      response = await task1(prompt=response)

asyncio.run(await main())

```

# ***More examples and tutorials coming soon.***

### Create your own Module

Clone the [base template](https://huggingface.co/NapthaAI/template) for creating task and flow modules, and follow the instructions in the readme for prototyping the module. You can check out other examples of task and flow modules at https://huggingface.co/NapthaAI.

Register your module on the Naptha Hub (Coming Soon).

# Run a Node
